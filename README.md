# ft_transcendence

> Time to shine! 

## Project Overview

ft_transcendence is a group project focused on creating a website for a Pong contest. The project requires adherence to specific technical and security constraints, with opportunities for modular enhancements.

## Essential Points

- **Decision-Making:** Flexibility in module implementation within specified constraints. Justifications may be required during evaluation.
- **Technology Use:** Use of libraries or tools that provide complete solutions for features or modules is prohibited. Small libraries for subcomponents are allowed.
- **Design Considerations:** Thorough understanding of project requirements is crucial before coding.

Thanks to your website, users will play Pong with others. 

## Mandatory Requirements

1. **Website Development**
   - Single-page application using pure vanilla JavaScript for frontend unless overridden by a module.The user should be able to use the Back and Forward buttons of the browser.
   - Backend in pure Ruby, unless overridden by a module.
   - Compatibility with the latest version of Google Chrome.
   - No unhandled errors or warnings during navigation.
   - Deployment via a single Docker command, using rootless mode on Linux clusters.

2. **Game Features**
   - Real-time multiplayer Pong game with identical paddle speeds for all players, including AI.
   - Tournament system with player registration and matchmaking.

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Password hashing, protection against SQL injections/XSS.
   - HTTPS for all connections.
   - Form and user input validation.

## Modules

- **Minimum of 7 Major Modules Required:**
  - Options include Web, User Management, Gameplay, AI-Algo, Cybersecurity, DevOps, Graphics, Accessibility, and Server-Side Pong.

## Evaluation
- While the visual aesthetics can vary, it must still capture the essence of the original Pong (1972).
- Justification required for any unapproved libraries or tools.
- Bonus points available for additional modules, assessed only if mandatory requirements are perfectly met.

## Version

- **Current Version:** 15.1
