## LGTM Stack

The LGTM stands for Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Prometheus (or Mimir), which are the key components of this stack. The LGTM stack aims to provide a unified solution for monitoring and troubleshooting modern applications and infrastructure by addressing the three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, and traces.
