# Kibana

To verify if Kibana is working correctly, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Access Kibana via Web Browser**
   - Kibana is typically accessible via port `5601`. Open your web browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:5601
     ```
   - If you're running Kibana on a remote server, replace `localhost` with the server's IP address or hostname.

### 2. **Check Kibana Status via API**
   - Kibana provides a status API that you can use to check if it's running properly. You can use `curl` or a similar tool to query the status:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET "http://localhost:5601/api/status"
     ```
   - If Kibana is running correctly, you should receive a JSON response with details about its status.

### 3. **Verify Kibana Logs**
   - If Kibana is not working as expected, check the logs for any errors. Since you're using Docker, you can view the logs using:
     ```bash
     docker logs kibana
     ```
   - Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate what's wrong.

### 4. **Check Kibana Healthcheck**
   - Your Docker Compose file already includes a healthcheck for Kibana:
     ```yaml
     healthcheck:
       test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -s -f http://localhost:5601/api/status || exit 1"]
       interval: 30s
       timeout: 10s
       retries: 3
     ```
   - You can check the health status of the Kibana container using:
     ```bash
     docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' kibana
     ```
   - This will show you the health status, including whether the healthcheck has passed or failed.

### 5. **Verify Elasticsearch Connection**
   - Kibana relies on Elasticsearch to function. Ensure that Elasticsearch is running and that Kibana can connect to it. You can check the Elasticsearch health status by visiting:
     ```
     http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
     ```
   - If Elasticsearch is healthy, you should see a JSON response with a `status` of `green` or `yellow`.

### 6. **Check Kibana Configuration**
   - Ensure that the `ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS` environment variable in your Docker Compose file is correctly set to point to your Elasticsearch instance:
     ```yaml
     environment:
       - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200
     ```
   - This configuration tells Kibana where to find Elasticsearch.

### 7. **Test Kibana Functionality**
   - Once Kibana is up and running, you can test its functionality by creating an index pattern or exploring the available data. Navigate to the "Discover" section in Kibana and try to create an index pattern based on the data stored in Elasticsearch.

### 8. **Check Network Configuration**
   - Ensure that both Kibana and Elasticsearch are on the same Docker network (`appnetwork` in your case). This allows them to communicate with each other. You can verify this by inspecting the network:
     ```bash
     docker network inspect appnetwork
     ```
   - Make sure both the `kibana` and `elasticsearch` containers are listed under the `Containers` section.

### 9. **Restart Kibana if Necessary**
   - If you made any configuration changes or if Kibana is not responding as expected, you can restart the Kibana container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose restart kibana
     ```

### 10. **Check for Resource Constraints**
   - If Kibana is slow or unresponsive, it might be due to resource constraints. Ensure that your Docker host has enough CPU and memory allocated to the Kibana container.

### Example of a Healthy Kibana Setup
If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to:
- Access the Kibana UI at `http://localhost:5601`.
- See a green or yellow status in the Elasticsearch health check (`http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health`).
- View logs in Kibana by creating an index pattern and exploring the data.
