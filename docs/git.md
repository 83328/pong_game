Yes, your general idea of reverting to a previous commit is correct, but there are nuances and best practices to consider when dealing with a shared `dev` branch. Force pushing directly onto a shared branch should be avoided if possible. Here's a breakdown of the best approaches:

**1. Identify the "Good" Commit:**

* **Git Log:** Use `git log --oneline dev` or `git log --graph dev` to examine the commit history of the `dev` branch.
* **Identify the Commit:** Find the commit hash (the short alphanumeric string) that represents the state of the `dev` branch *before* the problematic changes were introduced.

**2. Revert the Changes (Preferred Method):**

* **`git revert`:** This is generally the safest and most recommended approach. It creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the problematic commits.
    * `git revert <commit_hash_1>..<commit_hash_n>` (Revert a range of commits)
    * `git revert <commit_hash>` (Revert a single commit)
    * This creates a new commit that reverses the problematic changes, preserving the commit history.
    * It's collaborative-friendly because it doesn't rewrite history, which could cause issues for other developers who have based their work on the current `dev` branch.
    * After the revert commit(s), push it to the remote `dev` branch.
        * `git push origin dev`

**3. Resetting (Use with Caution):**

* **`git reset --hard <good_commit_hash>`:** This moves the `dev` branch pointer to the specified commit, effectively discarding all subsequent commits.
    * **Dangers:** This rewrites history, which can cause significant problems for other developers who have based their work on the current `dev` branch.
    * **When to Use:** Only use this if you're absolutely certain that no one else has based their work on the problematic commits, or if you have a very small team and excellent communication.
    * **Force Push:** If you do use `git reset --hard`, you'll need to force push the changes to the remote `dev` branch:
        * `git push -f origin dev`
        * **Extremely Important:** Communicate with your team *before* force pushing.

**4. Creating a Revert Pull Request (Best for Collaboration):**

* **Create a New Branch:** `git checkout -b revert-dev <good_commit_hash>`
* **Merge into Dev:** Create a pull request to merge `revert-dev` into `dev`.
* **Review:** Have your team review the pull request to ensure that the revert is correct.
* **Merge:** Merge the pull request.
* This approach is the most collaborative and safest method. It allows for code review and avoids force pushing.

**Why `git revert` is usually preferred:**

* **Preserves History:** It doesn't rewrite history, which is crucial for collaboration.
* **Auditing:** It allows you to track the changes that were reverted.
* **Safety:** It's less likely to cause conflicts with other developers' work.

## working across forks and branches
Alright, let's break down how to merge a branch from Henni's repository into your fork's `dev` branch on GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Prerequisites:**

* You have Git installed on your local machine.
* You have cloned your fork of Henni's repository to your local machine.
* You have added Henni's repository as a remote to your local clone.

**Steps:**

1.  **Add Henni's Repository as a Remote (If You Haven't Already):**

    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory of your local clone of your fork.
    * Use the following command to add Henni's repository as a remote (replace `henni` with the actual username and `repo-name` with the repository's name):

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/henni/repo-name.git
    ```

    * Verify that the remote was added correctly:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    * You should see `upstream` listed along with your `origin` remote.

2.  **Fetch Changes from Henni's Repository:**

    * Fetch the latest changes from Henni's repository:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

    * This will download all the branches and commits from Henni's repository without merging them into your local branches.

3.  **Identify the Branch You Want to Merge:**

    * List the branches in Henni's repository to find the branch you need (replace `branch-name` with the actual branch name):

    ```bash
    git branch -r
    ```
    * The branches from henni's repo will be listed as upstream/branch-name

4.  **Merge the Branch into Your `dev` Branch:**

    * Switch to your `dev` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```

    * Merge the branch from Henni's repository into your `dev` branch:

    ```bash
    git merge upstream/branch-name
    ```

    * If there are merge conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually. Git will guide you through this process.
    * If you want to create a new merge commit even when the merge could be a fast forward, use:
        ```bash
        git merge --no-ff upstream/branch-name
        ```

5.  **Push the Changes to Your Fork:**

    * Push the merged `dev` branch to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin dev
    ```
