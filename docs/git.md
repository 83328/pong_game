Yes, your general idea of reverting to a previous commit is correct, but there are nuances and best practices to consider when dealing with a shared `dev` branch. Force pushing directly onto a shared branch should be avoided if possible. Here's a breakdown of the best approaches:

**1. Identify the "Good" Commit:**

* **Git Log:** Use `git log --oneline dev` or `git log --graph dev` to examine the commit history of the `dev` branch.
* **Identify the Commit:** Find the commit hash (the short alphanumeric string) that represents the state of the `dev` branch *before* the problematic changes were introduced.

**2. Revert the Changes (Preferred Method):**

* **`git revert`:** This is generally the safest and most recommended approach. It creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the problematic commits.
    * `git revert <commit_hash_1>..<commit_hash_n>` (Revert a range of commits)
    * `git revert <commit_hash>` (Revert a single commit)
    * This creates a new commit that reverses the problematic changes, preserving the commit history.
    * It's collaborative-friendly because it doesn't rewrite history, which could cause issues for other developers who have based their work on the current `dev` branch.
    * After the revert commit(s), push it to the remote `dev` branch.
        * `git push origin dev`

**3. Resetting (Use with Caution):**

* **`git reset --hard <good_commit_hash>`:** This moves the `dev` branch pointer to the specified commit, effectively discarding all subsequent commits.
    * **Dangers:** This rewrites history, which can cause significant problems for other developers who have based their work on the current `dev` branch.
    * **When to Use:** Only use this if you're absolutely certain that no one else has based their work on the problematic commits, or if you have a very small team and excellent communication.
    * **Force Push:** If you do use `git reset --hard`, you'll need to force push the changes to the remote `dev` branch:
        * `git push -f origin dev`
        * **Extremely Important:** Communicate with your team *before* force pushing.

**4. Creating a Revert Pull Request (Best for Collaboration):**

* **Create a New Branch:** `git checkout -b revert-dev <good_commit_hash>`
* **Merge into Dev:** Create a pull request to merge `revert-dev` into `dev`.
* **Review:** Have your team review the pull request to ensure that the revert is correct.
* **Merge:** Merge the pull request.
* This approach is the most collaborative and safest method. It allows for code review and avoids force pushing.

**Why `git revert` is usually preferred:**

* **Preserves History:** It doesn't rewrite history, which is crucial for collaboration.
* **Auditing:** It allows you to track the changes that were reverted.
* **Safety:** It's less likely to cause conflicts with other developers' work.

**In summary:**

* For shared `dev` branches, `git revert` or a revert pull request are the best options.
* `git reset --hard` and force pushing should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and with clear communication.
* Always communicate with your team before making significant changes to a shared branch.
