# Project Setup

At the moment, there's not much to see, but you can easily interact with the project using the following commands.

## Available Commands

- **`make`**  
  Builds everything and starts all the services. After running this, you can visit the following URLs:

  - [localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)
  - [localhost:8000/api/hello](http://localhost:8000/api/hello)

  That's it for now!

- **`make test`**  
  Runs a basic backend test to check if the backend is functioning properly.

- **`make fclean`**  
  Stops all services and removes all Docker containers and volumes, effectively cleaning up the project.
