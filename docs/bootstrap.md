# Bootstrap Toolkit Overview

In our ft_transcendence project we use the Bootstrap toolkit. Bootstrap is an open-source, front-end framework designed to streamline the development of responsive, mobile-first web applications. Initially created by Twitter in 2011, it provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components to build consistent, visually appealing user interfaces.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Grid System**: A flexible 12-column grid for creating layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
- **Pre-Styled Components**: Includes buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, and more, reducing the need for custom CSS.
- **JavaScript Plugins**: Offers interactive features like carousels, dropdowns, and tooltips, powered by jQuery or native JavaScript in newer versions.
- **Customizable**: Easily modified via CSS variables, Sass, or custom themes to match project needs.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures consistent rendering across modern browsers.

## Benefits
- **Speed**: Accelerates development with ready-to-use components and utilities.
- **Consistency**: Maintains uniform design across projects.
- **Community and Documentation**: Extensive resources, tutorials, and a large community for support.

## Usage
Bootstrap can be included via CDN or installed locally (e.g., via npm). Itâ€™s ideal for rapid prototyping or full-scale web projects, such as this one.

Example inclusion via CDN:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
