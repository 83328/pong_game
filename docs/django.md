 # Django Framework Overview

Four our project we use Django as backend framework.
Django is an open-source, high-level Python web framework designed for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Created in 2005, it follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, enabling developers to build secure, scalable web applications efficiently.

## Key Features
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Simplifies database interactions by mapping Python objects to database tables, supporting databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Admin Interface**: Automatically generates a customizable admin panel for managing application data.
- **URL Routing**: Maps URLs to Python functions (views) for clean and dynamic routing.
- **Template Engine**: Provides a powerful templating system for rendering dynamic HTML.
- **Security**: Includes built-in protections against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and more.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Offers robust user management, including login, logout, and permission systems.
- **Scalability**: Supports modular design and can handle high-traffic applications with proper configuration.

## Benefits
- **Speed**: Accelerates development with pre-built components and a clear structure.
- **Security**: Strong default settings and tools to ensure secure applications.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Extensive documentation, tutorials, and a vast library of third-party packages (e.g., Django REST Framework).
- **Versatility**: Suitable for various projects, from small apps to large-scale systems like the 42 School ft_transcendence backend.

## Usage
Django is installed via pip (`pip install django`) and projects are created using the `django-admin startproject` command. Itâ€™s ideal for building the backend of web applications, handling user management, APIs, and database interactions.

Example project setup:
```bash
pip install django
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver
```
