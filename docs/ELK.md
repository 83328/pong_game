# Elastic Stack (ELK) Documentation

## Introduction to ELK Stack

The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is a powerful open-source log management and analytics platform. It consists of three main components that work together to ingest, process, analyze, and visualize log data:

- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine
- **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and ships data
- **Kibana**: A web-based visualization and exploration tool

In our development environment, the ELK Stack serves as a comprehensive logging solution that helps developers debug issues, monitor application behavior, and gain insights into system performance.

## ELK vs. Grafana Loki

While we use Grafana for metrics visualization, the ELK Stack has different strengths:

| Feature | ELK Stack | Grafana Loki |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Data Storage | Document-based (Elasticsearch) | Log entries only (more lightweight) |
| Querying | Full-text search, complex queries | LogQL (more limited, but efficient) |
| Resource Usage | Higher (more powerful) | Lower (more efficient) |
| Use Case | Full log analytics, complex searches | Simple log aggregation and visualization |
| Adoption | Industry standard, widely adopted | Newer, gaining popularity |

ELK is generally preferred when you need powerful search capabilities and complex analytics, while Loki is better suited for simple log storage and basic querying with lower resource requirements.

## Components and Their Roles

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is the core of the ELK Stack, functioning as a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability. It:

- Stores all of your log data in a searchable index
- Enables near real-time searching and analytics
- Provides a RESTful API for data operations
- Handles distributed storage and search

### Logstash

Logstash is the data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to Elasticsearch. It:

- Collects logs from various sources (GELF, syslog, files, etc.)
- Parses and transforms logs using filters
- Enriches data with additional context
- Forwards processed data to Elasticsearch

Read more about Elastic Search here: [logstash.md](logstash.md).

### Kibana

Kibana is the visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. It:

- Provides a user-friendly web interface for exploring logs
- Offers customizable dashboards for data visualization
- Enables creation of searches, graphs, charts, and tables
- Includes tools for log analysis and monitoring
