# WebSockets vs. WebTransport

## WebSockets
WebSockets is a communication protocol that provides **full-duplex** communication over a **single TCP connection**. It allows real-time, bi-directional data transfer between a client and a server.

### Features:
- **Persistent Connection**: Once established, the connection remains open.
- **Low Latency**: Ideal for real-time applications like chat, live notifications, and multiplayer games.
- **Uses TCP**: Ensures reliable delivery of messages.
- **Widely Supported**: Available in most modern web browsers.

### Use Cases:
- Chat applications (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp Web)
- Live stock market updates
- Multiplayer online games
- Real-time notifications

## WebTransport
WebTransport is a newer communication protocol designed to improve performance and flexibility compared to WebSockets. It operates over **HTTP/3 and QUIC**, offering **low-latency and multiplexing** capabilities.

### Features:
- **Multiplexing**: Can handle multiple streams efficiently without head-of-line blocking.
- **Low Latency**: Uses QUIC, reducing connection setup times.
- **Supports UDP and Reliable Streams**: Offers both reliable and unreliable data transfer options.
- **Better for High-Performance Applications**: Suitable for video streaming, real-time gaming, and IoT applications.

### Use Cases:
- Live video and audio streaming
- Cloud gaming and VR applications
- High-frequency trading applications

## Why Choose WebTransport?

While WebSockets is a well-established solution for real-time communication, WebTransport offers several advantages that make it a better choice for high-performance applications:

1. **Lower Latency**: WebTransport, built on QUIC, establishes connections faster and reduces latency compared to WebSockets' TCP-based communication.
2. **Multiplexing Support**: Unlike WebSockets, WebTransport allows multiple streams over a single connection, avoiding head-of-line blocking.
3. **Flexible Reliability**: WebTransport supports both reliable and unreliable delivery, making it more suitable for applications like video streaming and cloud gaming.
4. **Better Performance in Unstable Networks**: QUIC-based WebTransport is more resilient to network changes, improving performance in mobile and unstable connections.
5. **Future-Proof**: As the web moves towards HTTP/3, WebTransport is better aligned with future networking advancements.

**Conclusion**:
Since our application requires low latency, efficient data transfer, and support for unreliable streams (the Pong game in real-time), **WebTransport is the superior choice over WebSockets**.
