## I made a change but the make rebuild is not working

There are several ways to restart a Docker container and force a rebuild, depending on what you mean by "rebuild." Here's a breakdown:

1. Restarting the Container (Without Rebuilding the Image):

This simply stops and starts the container using the existing image.
docker restart <container_name_or_id>
This is useful for applying configuration changes that don't require a new image.
2. Recreating the Container (Using the Existing Image):

This removes the existing container and creates a new one from the same image.
docker rm -f <container_name_or_id>
docker run <your_run_options> <image_name>
This is useful for applying changes to the container's configuration (e.g., environment variables, volumes) without rebuilding the image.
3. Rebuilding the Image and Recreating the Container:

This is the most comprehensive approach, where you rebuild the Docker image from your Dockerfile and then create a new container from the updated image.
Rebuild the image:
docker build -t <image_name> <path_to_Dockerfile>
If you want to force a rebuild even if the Dockerfile hasn't changed, use the --no-cache flag:
docker build --no-cache -t <image_name> <path_to_Dockerfile>
Remove the old container:
docker rm -f <container_name_or_id>
Create a new container from the rebuilt image:
docker run <your_run_options> <image_name>
If you are using docker-compose.
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
